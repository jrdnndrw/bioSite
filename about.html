          />Wakako Nishimura-Anderson (she/her) is a UX Engineer for Target
          Corporation. She started her career as a process analyst while going
          to school part-time for Computer Science. In that role, she worked on
          managing projects for IT contractors. Wakako transitioned to a
          software engineer role after managing projects for two years. As an
          engineer, she worked on writing automation software for recovering
          failing technology at Target stores and worked on solving incidents
          that would fall into their workgroup bucket. During that process, she
          worked on some of the front-end code for mobile apps and developed an
          interest in UX design. When the pandemic hit, her engineering team
          went through a reorganization, which gave her an opening to look
          further into UX as a career. During the reorg, she started working on
          her first UX case study and presented a presentation for interviews.
          When a UX designer role opened, she applied immediately and made her
          next career transition while fully remote. After her second year in UX
          design, she completed her degree in Comp Science and then went back to
          school to study UX, using her background in engineering to help
          combine the two disciplines as a UX Engineer. She is finishing a boot
          camp course in UX and UI design and plans to go back to school after
          she completes the course. Outside of her career goals, she is a
          passionate animal advocate, volunteering on the board of directors as
          a secretary for a nonprofit called Dogs Of a Good Society (DOGS). She
          is also on a competitive dog relay racing team sport called flyball
          with her rescue dog, Mochi. Together, they've competed for ten years
          and just started training their most recent foster failure, Rocky.

          The sport of flyball dog racing consists of a relay race between two
          separate teams with four dogs. Each dog has a handler that will
          release the dog when it is its turn to run. The dogs run down a track,
          jumping over four hurdles until they reach the flyball box. Once the
          dog reaches the flyball box, it will perform a swimmer's turn on the
          box that triggers the release of a ball. The dog must catch the ball
          and run back down the track jumping over the four hurdles. As a dog
          returns down the track, another dog will be released to run down the
          track. The team that completes the race with all four dogs the fastest
          wins that race. Teams must win three out of five races to take the
          overall win. Flyball is a great sport for any dog and helps create a
          strong bond between you and your dog. It's an excellent outlet for
          active dogs who need an engaging activity to tire them out. The

          says, “There best way to get started in Flyball is to find a club in
          your area that offers classes and you can train with. Remember,
          Flyball is a team sport so it is important to find a team that works
          for you and your dog. There are several clubs that host seminars and
          that offer on-line classes as well. Look for Flyball clubs in your
          state and read the NAFA Rulebook.”
